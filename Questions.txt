A) Git Branching strategy.

A branching strategy is a set of rules or guidelines that development teams use to manage the process of writing, merging, and deploying code with the help of a version control system like Git. It defines how developers interact with a shared codebase.

Strategies like these are essential as they help in keeping project repositories organized, error-free, and avoid the unwanted merge conflicts when multiple developers simultaneously push and pull code from the same repository.

Common Git Branching Strategies:

1. GitFlow Workflow:
GitFlow enables parallel development, allowing developers to work separately on feature branches. A feature branch is created from a master branch, and after completion of changes the feature branch is merged with the master branch.

Types of branches that are present in GitFlow:
1. Master
2. Develop
3. Feature Branches
4. Release Branches
5. Hotfix Branches

The Master and Develop branches are the main branches that remain throughout the journey of the software. The other branches are supporting branches and are short-lived that serving specific purposes.

2. GitHub Flow:
GitHub flow is a simpler alternative to GitFlow, best for smaller teams and projects. GitHub flow only has feature branches that stem directly from the master branch and are merged back to master after completing changes.

Types of branches that are present in GitFlow:
1. Master
2. Feature

3. GitLab Flow:
GitLab flow is more scalable alternative to GitFlow. It is designed for teams using GitLab as their version control system and offers a more flexible approach to continuous integration and automated testing.

Types of branches that can be present in GitFlow:
1. Master
2. Develop
3. Feature
4. Release

4. Trunk Based Development:
It is a branching strategy where developers work on a single "trunk" branch, mostly the master branch and use feature flags to isolate features until they are ready for release. This main branch should be ready for release any time. No additional branches are created.

The main idea behind this strategy is to make small, frequent changes to avoid merge conflicts and limit long-lasting branches. This strategy enables continuous integration and delivery, making it an attractive choice for teams aiming to release updates regularly and smoothly. It is especially useful for smaller projects or teams looking for a simpler workflow.

B) What is merge conflict? How would one resolve it?
A merge conflict occurs in version control systems like Git when two different branches have changes to the same part of a file, and Git can't automatically determine which change to keep.

What causes a merge conflict?
1. Conflicting lines of code: Two developers edit the same line of code differently in separate branches. 
2. File deletion: One branch deletes a file, while another branch modifies it. 

How to resolve a merge conflict:

1. Identify the conflicted files: Use git status to see which files have unmerged paths. 
2. Open the conflicted file(s): Use a text editor or a conflict resolution tool to view the file. 
3. Edit the file to resolve the conflict: Look for the conflict markers ( <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>). 
   <<<<<<< HEAD (or the branch name) marks the start of the changes in your current branch. 
   ======== separates the changes from the other branch. 
   >>>>>>> branch-name marks the end of the changes from the other branch. 
   Decide which changes to keep: You can keep one version, combine both, or write entirely new code to replace the conflicted sections.
   Remove the conflict markers: Once you've decided on the correct code, delete all the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>). 
5. Save the file: Save the changes you made to the file. 
6. Stage and commit the changes: Use git add <filename> to stage the resolved file and then git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts" to
   save the changes. 
7. Test and push: Test your changes to ensure everything works correctly, and then push them to the remote repository.
